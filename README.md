Made with Remix (React, React Router), Firebase, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Features to add

- [ ] Finish app

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Finish base app first

## Quick Start

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
